# Univerlist Landing Page Clone

I cloned the landing page of Univerlist. The original webpage can be reached trough this link [https://univerlist.com]. 
I cloned this webpage to practise html, css and JavaScript. I didn't do any API calls so the page is totally static. 


## Aspects 

- The clone is fully responsive and pixel-perfect.
- Only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrapt and JQuery are used.
- Details like "in mobile phones, menu is oppened from right side with animations" are implemented.


## Running The Project

After clonning the repo to your computer. Just open index.html with a browser (double clickling on this file should make it).
